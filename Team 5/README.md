# The impact of CV-19 on crime and future data recovery
## CUSP London Data Dive 2020

CV-19 has had a significant impact on the capital across a wealth of areas. The full extent of this damage is beyond the scope of the question. The focus here is to explore the impact upon crime following CV-19. Following the outbreak, we have seen large reductions across many crime types (i.e., acquisitive crime, knife crime) whereas others have seen increases (Domestic Abuse and Anti-Social Behaviour).  However, less is known around which geographic areas have been most impacted and why (drawing upon wider population and societal data) as well as making predictions as to what we will see in the future.
