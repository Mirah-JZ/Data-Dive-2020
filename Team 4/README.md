# Can the localised drivers of knife crime be identified and how do they sit in the wider picture?
## CUSP London Data Dive 2020

Knife crime is a key priority for London, as raised earlier â€“ over the past 10 years London has seen as peak, a fall, and subsequent rise again. Can we enhance our analytics into the topic of knife crime, including both the background as well as the future? Can a deep dive into one borough reveal new insights for London?  
 
This question will be able to draw upon London wide knife crime data, wider social-economic data, as well as rich data from one London Borough.  Can we understand more than the trends? Seek to understand the factors that are related to changes in knife crime (i.e., societal or economic?) and explore the risk and protective factors that drive knife crime.
