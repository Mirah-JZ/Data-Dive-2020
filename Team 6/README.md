# [Predicting future crime demand for London - where will future demand come from?]
## CUSP London Data Dive 2020

[Can we, using crime data alongside a wide range of other social and economic data sets (ie., income, school attainment, justice data) to develop models/tools that are able to predict future crime trends (i.e., overall crime / knife crime/ Domestic Abuse) – thus enabling us to predict the likely key areas contributing towards this. Within this, are there areas that we would predict to have high or increasing crime based on such key factors (i.e. income, deprivation, school attainment) but whom do not see an increase. In these cases, is it possible to identify ‘protective’ factors in these areas?  
 
Ideally this question should focus on the Pre-cv-19 time period, to understand the what the situation would have been and where future issues may be.]
