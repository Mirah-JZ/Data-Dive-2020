# What is the impact of Stop & Search on crime? 
## CUSP London Data Dive 2020

Does stop and search have an impact on crime, and if so, which crime types?  In which areas? How much Stop and Search is required to have an actual impact? Furthermore, are differing outcomes (i.e., arrest or no further action rates), levels of disproportionality within the S&S, or basic volume related at all to any potential impact?  We could explore the crimes prior to and then subsequent to any given stop and search (in a specific area, i.e., street level) or other analysis to understand impact. Additionally, is there wider societal data that enables a richer understanding of Stop and Search (i.e., locations or influencing success).
